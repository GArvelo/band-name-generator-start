#1. Create a greeting
print( "Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
#2. Ask the user for the city. Also use the \n to create the answer on a new line.
city = input("What's name of the city you grew up in?\n")
#3. Ask the user for the pet name. Also use the \n to create the answer on a new line.
pet = input("What's your pet's name?\n")
